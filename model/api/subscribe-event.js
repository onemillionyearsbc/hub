/**
 * Part of a course on Hyperledger Fabric: 
 * http://ACloudFan.com
 * 
 * Composer 0.19.0
 * 
 * Pre-Requisites
 * 1. Launch Fabric - Deploy Aircraft v8
 * 2. Launch REST Server
 * 
 * Demonstrates event subscription on HL fabric.
 * 1. Create the business network connection
 * 2. Subscribe to event stream - as of Jan 2017, criteria based subscription is not available
 *              https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/applications/subscribing-to-events.html
 * 3. Filter event 
 * 4. If Receieved event = FlightCreated then process it otherwise ignore
 * 
 * To Test:
 * 1. In REST server interface, initiate the CreateFlight transaction
